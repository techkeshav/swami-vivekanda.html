    <span id="Vivekananda">V</span>ivekananda was born Narendranath Datta in a Bengali family at his ancestral home in
    Calcutta, the capital of British India, on 12 January 1863 during the Makar Sankranti festival. He belonged to a
    traditional family and was one of nine siblings. His father, Vishwanath Datta, was an attorney (Attorney at law, an
    official title of lawyers in some jurisdictions) at the Calcutta High Court. Durgacharan Datta, Narendra's
    grandfather was a Sanskrit and Persian scholar who left his family and became a monk at age twenty-five.His mother,
    Bhubaneswari Devi, was a devout housewife. The progressive, rational attitude of Narendra's father and the religious
    temperament of his mother helped shape his thinking and personality.Narendranath was interested in spirituality from
    a young age and used to meditate before the images of deities such as Shiva, Rama, Sita, and Mahavir Hanuman. He was
    fascinated by wandering ascetics and monks.Narendra was naughty and restless as a child, and his parents often had
    difficulty controlling him. His mother said, "I prayed to Shiva for a son and he has sent me one of his demons".

    Swami Vivekanada was an Indian Hindu monk and philosopher. He was a chief disciple of the 19th-century Indian mystic
    Ramakrishna.Influenced by Western esotericism (Western esotericism is a term scholars use to categorise a wide range
    of loosely related ideas and movements that developed within Western society), he was a key figure in the
    introduction of the Indian darsanas (teachings, practices) of Vedanta and Yoga to the Western world, and is credited
    with raising interfaith awareness, bringing Hinduism to the status of a major world religion during the late 19th
    century. Vivekananda founded the Ramakrishna Math and the Ramakrishna Mission. He is perhaps best known for his
    speech which began with the words "Sisters and brothers of America ...," in which he introduced Hinduism at the
    Parliament of the World's Religions in Chicago in 1893.

    He was influenced by his guru, Ramakrishna, from whom he learnt that all living beings were an embodiment of the
    divine self; therefore, service to God could be rendered by service to humankind. After Ramakrishna's death,
    Vivekananda toured the Indian subcontinent extensively and acquired first-hand knowledge of the conditions
    prevailing in British India. He later travelled to the United States, representing India at the 1893 Parliament of
    the World's Religions. Vivekananda conducted hundreds of public and private lectures and classes, disseminating
    tenets of Hindu philosophy in the United States, England and Europe. In India, Vivekananda is regarded as a
    patriotic saint, and his birthday is celebrated as National Youth Day.
